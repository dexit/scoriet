# scoriet
Scoriet - a source code generator - source - templates &amp; installer

First upload after changing license to open-source

Scoriet is written in WinDev, this version is in WinDev 22, english version

WinDev is a 4GL programming language. WinDev is not open-source. WinDev has a commercial hardware dongle!

Why WinDev and not C++ or Java?

WinDev has the ability to execute code in runtime. This makes WinDev unique, only PHP has this ability!

Scoriet works with templates, the generator reads every template and compiles it, execute it and the execution of the template generates the final application.

Scoriet must import in first your application database. It imports it in Hyper File classic database in order to produce fast the result. Every database table, field, link, key can be translated to several languages! So if you generate the application, you have your captions in the desired language!

Scoriet has a database import version, so you can make for example a laravel migrations/database updates!

Scoriet delivers a PHP sample template, be kind, this was not my best work, I wanted to deliver a model-view-controller template, with savvy a PHP framework (like smarty, but as PHP template language!), but time was against me... sorry, so I deliver a CRUD template but with bootstrap css framework. My dream is to devliver a Yii and Laravel Template with Bootstrap, mirgations aso.
